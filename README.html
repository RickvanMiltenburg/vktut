# Coding conventions

The source code as provided holds to the following conventions for clarity and consistency:

- All Vulkan-related code is written in C instead of C++ (Explanation follows)
- All lines of source code are restricted to 100 characters of code for easy side-by-side editing
at 1080p resolution. Some lines might selectively exceed this limit.

## Use of C

*C99, specifically*

Vulkan-related code is written in C for both convenience and clarity. Considerations concerning
performance and related metrics were not related to this decision.

C provides us with two convenience features not adopted in C++ (as of C++14 at least) that provide
tangible benefit when working with Vulkan, as Vulkan very heavily relies upon recursive, temporary
structures for passing arguments to functions:

- **Designated initializers**

Given any structure, such as for example...

~~~~~~
typedef struct foo { int a; const char* b; double c; } foo;
~~~~~~

... we are normally able to initialize such structures by the use of an initializer list in both C
and C++ as follows:

~~~~~~
foo bar { 2, "hello", 10.3 };
~~~~~~

However, the parameters are non-obvious from the initialization perspective, especially for a large
number of parameters. In addition, Vulkan is written to be compatible with C, and for this reason
they do not contain constructors.

We could solve the problem in both C and C++ as follows...

~~~~~~
foo bar = { 0 };    // Initialize all members to 0
bar.a = 2;
bar.b = "hello";
bar.c = 10.3;
~~~~~~

... but C99 and on provide a helpful shorthand:

~~~~~~
foo bar { .a = 2, .b = "hello", .c = 10.3 };
~~~~~~

Members can be initialized out-of-order with the designated initializer (though this is best to be
avoided) and members not specified in the designated initializer (eg if we left out ".b = ...")
will be initialized to NULL/0.

Since there are a lot of large structures with members we would selectively wish to initialize and
some we do not care for, designated initializers are used frequently in the example application.

- **Compound literals**

While not that dissimilar from type constructors in C++, combined with designated initializers,
this can be a powerful feature as it allows not only for inline temporary struct initialization,
but also inline **array** and **pointer** initialization. Eg

~~~~~~
typedef struct foo_entry { const char* foo; } foo_entry;
typedef struct foo_cnt { int count; } foo_cnt;
typedef struct foos { foo_cnt foo_counter; foo_entry* foos; } foos;

void DoSomething ( foos* bars )
{

}

int main ( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
	DoSomething (
		&(foos){
			.foo_counter.count = 5, // Initialization in members is also allowed btw
			.foos = (foo_entry[5]){
				{ .foo = "hello" },
				{ .foo = "world" },
				{ .foo = "how" },
				{ .foo = "are" },
				{ .foo = "you" },
			}
		}
	);
}
~~~~~~

## The alternative

While this is the solution I personally preferred, there is also a C++ wrapper for Vulkan in
`vulkan.hpp`. (where the non-wrapped C equivalent is `vulkan.h`) This was not yet core when I was
actively working on a Vulkan project, and as such, I have no experience working with it. I have
only given it a cursory glance, and from that glance found it looked unnecessarily bloated to the
point of potentially being detremental to learning the API itself rather than how it was wrapped.

We encourage you to take a look at the Vulkan C++ header if you decide to implement Vulkan for one
of your projects, but for this lecture, the header was dropped in favor for just going with C.

# Running the source code

The following steps are required to get the example to run on the target platform.

## Setting up

### Windows

The following software is required:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- [Latest version of LunarG Vulkan SDK for Windows (1.0.30.0 at the time of writing)](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

The application itself does not need to be *compiled* on Vulkan-capable hardware, but does need to
be *run* on Vulkan-capable hardware.

**NOTE:** (Intel) Vulkan is only supported on Skylake integrated graphics chips and later. In
addition, Vulkan support is **NOT** in the standard graphics drivers as provided by Intel! Vulkan
support is only available in select Beta drivers, the most recent one being from June 29, 2016. It
is advisable to develop on non-Intel hardware for the time being.

When both pieces of software are installed, please check whether or not the `VK_SDK_PATH`
environment variable is set to the proper path. To do so, type `%VK_SDK_PATH` in Windows Explorer.
This should direct you to your Vulkan install folder.

*If Visual Studio was open while installing the Vulkan SDK, **restart Visual Studio** so it will
pick up the newly added / changed `VK_SDK_PATH` environment variable!*

If everything checks out, open vktut.sln.

### Android

The following software is required:

- Android Studio
- Android SDK (API 23 or 24, depending upon the version of Android you are targeting)
- [Latest version of LunarG Vulkan SDK for Windows (1.0.30.0 at the time of writing)](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
- A couple of other dependencies Android Studio will for the most part resolve, as I recall anyway

With Android Studio etc setup, select "Open project" and open the "project/android" folder.

## Shader compilation

For the most part, pressing Run/Debug should run the application on your target platform. But
before the application will run properly, you should compile the shaders. Without the shaders,
the application is very unlikely to run appropriately. (Or rather: Guaranteed not to)

There are two options for compiling the shaders.

1. **shadercompile.bat**: This simply calls the Vulkan reference GLSL compiler to compile the GLSL
   files to SPIR-V
2. **shader_watchdog.py**: This is similar, but will keep on running even when complete. When
   editing any of the shader files, the script will automatically recognize the modification
   and trigger a recompile of that specific shader file. In addition, if any error occurs,
   this script will scream at you. This is much better for the development pipeline, as you'll
   never end up wondering why you don't see any difference after changing the shader and forgetting
   to compile it, and you will quickly realize any potential mistakes right when saving the shader
   file.
   Do note that this script has external dependencies on Python and the Python "watchdog" package!
